## Features

- **Live multiplayer** — host creates a room, teams join with a 6-character code
- **Question manager** — full CRUD UI to add, edit, and delete questions without touching a database; includes Deezer search for music questions (auto-fills preview URL, options, and answer)
- **Multiple question types** — Multiple Choice, Music (30s audio preview via Deezer), Video, Image
- **Music round** — host searches Deezer from the question manager, saves the 30s preview URL; during the game the host presses Play/Stop and audio streams on all player and screen devices simultaneously
- **Big screen view** — a separate projection URL (`/screen/:code`) for TVs or projectors; auto-discovers the active game at `/screen` if only one session is running
- **Host as player** — host can optionally compete as their own team with a custom team name, and appears on the scoreboard
- **Rich scoring system** — speed bonuses, first-answer bonuses, wrong-answer penalties, skip mechanics, and round types
- **Skip mechanic** — teams can skip questions, but consecutive skips increase the penalty for future wrong answers; blocked after 4 skips in a row
- **Round types** — host sets the scoring mode per round; it applies for the entire round and can only be changed between rounds; **Chaos** mode picks a random rule per question
- **Streak tracking** — consecutive correct answers are tracked and displayed: a 🔥 chip appears on the player's answer screen, a streak badge shows on the scoreboard, and the round type **Hot Streak** amplifies streaks with a stacking multiplier
- **Rank movement** — after each question the scoreboard shows ▲/▼ arrows indicating how many positions each team moved since the previous question
- **Lone Wolf winner banner** — when a Lone Wolf question resolves, the winning team sees "You won this round!" and all others see who scored
- **Host question preview** — before each question goes live, the host sees the question and answer privately, can read it aloud, and optionally preview 10s of a music track; players and the big screen wait until the host presses Start
- **Player-moderated mode** — optional no-host progression: in results, teams tap **Ready for next question**; when all active teams are ready, the next question starts automatically

## Scoring System

### Base formula (correct answer)

```
points = round((basePoints + speedBonus + firstAnswerBonus) × roundMultiplier)
```

| Component | Value |
|---|---|
| Base points | Set per question (default 1 000) |
| Speed bonus | Up to +50% of base, linear from answer time 0 → time limit |
| First-answer bonus | +100 flat (first team to answer correctly per question) |
| Wrong-answer penalty | 250–750 pts depending on speed (suppressed in Safety Net round) |

### Wrong-answer penalty

The penalty scales with how fast you answered — answering quickly and getting it wrong costs more.

```
penalty = 500 × (0.5 + speedRatio) × skipPenaltyMultiplier
```

| Answer speed | Speed factor | Base penalty |
|---|---|---|
| Instant | ×1.5 | −750 pts |
| Mid-timer | ×1.0 | −500 pts |
| Last second | ×0.5 | −250 pts |

### Skip penalty

Skipping is allowed but punishes teams that answer wrong afterwards. Consecutive skips stack a multiplier onto the wrong-answer penalty. After 4 consecutive skips, the team is **forced to answer** the next question — if they don't, they receive the penalty automatically when time runs out (at minimum speed factor ×0.5 since they waited).

| Consecutive skips | Skip multiplier | Example mid-timer penalty |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ×1.00 | −500 pts |
| 1 | ×1.25 | −625 pts |
| 2 | ×1.50 | −750 pts |
| 3 | ×1.75 | −875 pts |
| 4 (max — must answer) | ×2.00 | −1 000 pts |

Both multipliers stack: `penalty = 500 × speedFactor × skipMultiplier`.

Answering (correctly or wrongly) resets the consecutive skip count to 0. The scoreboard shows each team's current skip count so other teams are aware.

### Round types

The host sets a round type before starting the round. It applies for **all questions in that round** and cannot be changed mid-round.

| Round type | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Normal** | Standard scoring |
| **🔥 Hot Streak** | Each consecutive correct answer adds ×0.25 to that team's multiplier (stacks up to ×2.0) |
| **🛡️ Safety Net** | Wrong-answer penalty is suppressed — teams cannot lose points this round |
| **🐺 Lone Wolf** | Only the **first** team to answer correctly earns points; all others get 0 |
| **⚡ Double Down** | All correct-answer points are doubled |
| **🎲 Chaos** | Each question randomly applies one of the four special round rules |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher (v26 recommended — use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd pub-quiz
```

### 2. Set up the database

1. Open your Supabase project → SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `backend/src/db/schema.sql` to create all tables and seed sample questions

### 3. Configure the backend

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5174
PORT=3001
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 5. Run in development

In two separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (port 3001)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend (port 5174)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open:
- **Game**: `http://localhost:5174`
- **API**: `http://localhost:3001`

## How to Play

### Host
1. Go to `/` → **Host a Game**
2. Enter your name; optionally enable **Play as a team** to compete as your own team with a custom name
3. Click **Create Room** and share the 6-character room code with teams
4. In the lobby, configure the round: number of questions, category, **round type**, and moderation mode (**Host controlled** or **Players controlled**)
5. Optionally open the **Screen View** link on a projector/TV
6. Click **Start Game** when everyone has joined
7. If moderation mode is **Host controlled**, review the **preview** (question + answer) and press **Start Question** when ready
8. If moderation mode is **Players controlled**, teams advance the game from results using **Ready for next question** (no host action required between questions)
9. Between rounds, reconfigure round settings before starting the next round
10. Click **Show Scoreboard** at any time to reveal the full overlay on all screens

### Teams
1. Go to `/join` on any device (or scan the QR code on the screen view)
2. Enter the room code and a team name
3. Answer questions before time runs out
4. Use **Skip** to pass a question — but watch out: consecutive skips increase the penalty for wrong answers, and you are forced to answer after 4 skips in a row

### Big Screen
- Open `/screen/:code` on any TV or projector for a lobby view, live question display, and results

---

## Question Manager

Go to `/manage` to add, edit, and delete questions without touching the database directly.

- Supports **Multiple Choice** (up to 4 options, click to mark the correct answer), **Music**, **Video**, and **Image** types
- **Music questions**: search Deezer to find a track — the 30s preview URL, question text ("Name this song:"), answer, and decoy options are all auto-filled from the search results
- Filter and search questions by category, difficulty, or keyword
- Set custom **point values** and **time limits** per question

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Your Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase service role key (keep secret) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Yes | Frontend URL(s), comma-separated (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`) |
| `PORT` | No | Backend port (default: `3001`; cloud hosts inject this) |

### Frontend (Vite / Vercel)

| Variable | Required in prod | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SOCKET_URL` | Yes on Vercel | Public HTTPS origin of the hosted backend (Socket.io) |
| `VITE_API_URL` | No | REST base; defaults to `VITE_SOCKET_URL` when unset |

> **Never commit `.env` to version control.** The `.gitignore` already excludes it.  
> Vite bakes `VITE_*` at **build** time — change them in Vercel, then **redeploy**.

---

## Deploying (Vercel + Render / Railway)

The Vercel site is a **static SPA**. Live games need the Node/Socket.io server in `backend/` on a host that supports WebSockets. LAN/Wi‑Fi is **not** required once both are hosted.

### 1. Deploy the backend (pick one)

**Render (recommended free path)**  
1. Connect this repo on [Render](https://render.com) → New → Blueprint (uses root [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml)), or New Web Service with **Root Directory** `backend`, build `npm install`, start `npm start`.  
2. Set env vars from `backend/.env.example` (`SUPABASE_*`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, optional Spotify/YouTube).  
3. `CORS_ORIGIN` = your Vercel URL (add preview URLs comma-separated if needed).  
4. Note the service URL, e.g. `https://quizmebaby-api.onrender.com`. Hit `/health` — expect `{ "status": "ok" }`.  
   Free-tier services may sleep; the first request can take ~30s.

**Railway**  
1. New project → deploy from GitHub → **Root Directory** `backend` (see [`backend/railway.toml`](./backend/railway.toml)).  
2. Same env vars as above.  
3. Use the generated public HTTPS URL as `VITE_SOCKET_URL`.

### 2. Point the Vercel frontend at the backend

In the Vercel project → **Settings → Environment Variables** (Production):

```env
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://YOUR-BACKEND-HOST
VITE_API_URL=https://YOUR-BACKEND-HOST
```

Redeploy the frontend. Create Room / Join should reach the hosted Socket.io server (no same-Wi‑Fi message for a missing cloud backend).

Local/LAN play still works: run `backend` + `frontend` with the Vite proxy; leave `VITE_SOCKET_URL` unset in local `.env`.
